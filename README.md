The Card Parser Project is a simple Django-based web application that allows users to upload one or multiple credit card statement PDFs and automatically extract key information from them. The system processes the uploaded files and identifies important details such as the bank name, card variant, last four digits of the card, total amount due, billing cycle dates, payment due date, and individual transaction records with date, description, and amount. It uses Python libraries like PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, or PyPDF2 for reading PDF content and applies regular expressions and string parsing techniques to extract relevant data accurately. The project includes a clean and minimal web interface built with Django templates where users can easily upload their files and view all the extracted results in a structured and readable format. It is designed to simplify credit card statement analysis and can be extended to support multiple bank formats or export options like CSV or Excel in the future.
